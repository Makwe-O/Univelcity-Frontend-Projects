// Lets build a twitter. Yeah If only it were that easy.
// Build seriously tho lets try and build something simple that takes
// the basics of what youve learnt so far to mimic build an app like twitter

// Have a prompt that askes the user for his email and password.(Hint: The actual email and
// password for that user should already have been stored in some sort of db)
// Check if the user exists and with appropriate error messages
// Once the user is logged in have some feed that the user can see

// See there you have it twitter.... sort of :)
